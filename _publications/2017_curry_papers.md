excerpt: 'We sequenced the cholorplast genomes and constructed the phylogeny of the Clauseneae tribe, part of the Rutaceae (Citrus) family. We further sequenced the transcriptome through leaf development for the curry tree (<i>Bergera koenigii</i>) to identify differentially expressed genes.'

We sequenced the cholorplast genomes and constructed the phylogeny of the Clauseneae tribe, part of the Rutaceae (Citrus) family. We further sequenced the transcriptome through leaf development for the curry tree (<i>Bergera koenigii</i>) to identify differentially expressed genes.
